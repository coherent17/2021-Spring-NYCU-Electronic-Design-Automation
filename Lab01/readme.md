type "make" to compile the source code
```bash = 
make
```

type "make runall" to run through the 3 sample input testcases
```bash = 
make runall
```

type "./Lab1 [input file name]" will output the output.txt file which store the partition of the cell
```bash = 
./Lab1 [input file name]
```

type "make clean" to delete the object & binary & output.txt file
```bash = 
make clean
```

Note that I think there might exist some files problems between windows and linux, when I create my personal input on windows, and upload to the workspace, the code can't read the file successfully. However, if I create the input testing file on linux by Vim, I can read the file successfully without the segmentfault. Therefore, if there exists the segmentfault, might be an issue from the above condition. Let me know if I got the SegmentFault when reading the file, which is not create on linux. Thanks!
